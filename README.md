<h3> Basic Setup for Vim and ZSH

<h2> These are my VIM and OH-MY-ZSH config files 

.vimrc is my configuration file for VIM

.zshrc is the aliases and settings for OH-MY-ZSH

c.vim is a syntax file to highlight struct types according to the norm of Ecole 42
~/.vim/syntax/c.vim

At some point I should make a script to install and add all this stuff :)
