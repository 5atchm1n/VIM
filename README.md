These are my VIM and OH-MY-ZSH config files

These are the basic packages/plugins you need in order to make best use of my dotfiles !!

.vimrc is my configuration file for VIM

.zshrc is the aliases and settings for OH-MY-ZSH

c.vim is a syntax file to highlight struct types according to the norm of Ecole 42
~/.vim/syntax/c.vim


At some point I should make a script to install and add all this stuff :)
