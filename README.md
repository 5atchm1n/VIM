# BASIC SETUP

### pre-requisites

*UNIX like OS*

*zsh -- 5.0.8 and newer --* [INSTALL ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)

*VIM 8+*

These are the basic packages/plugins you need in order to make best use of my dotfiles !!

https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh  

https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree

https://github.com/ajh17/Spacegray.vim

you can full custom your setup by reading all that doc and the https://www.vim.org/docs.php[vim doc]

Or just trust me and run the following commands  -- at your own risk 

Basic Setup for Vim and ZSH
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

These are my VIM and OH-MY-ZSH config files 

.vimrc is my configuration file for VIM

.zshrc is the aliases and settings for OH-MY-ZSH

c.vim is a syntax file to highlight struct types according to the norm of Ecole 42
~/.vim/syntax/c.vim

At some point I should make a script to install and add all this stuff :)
